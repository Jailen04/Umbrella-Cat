# Umbrella-Cat
Making a game where it rains and the objective is to keep a cat from getting wet.

Features

The game will use some of the basic code of the rain.py game in the last assignment but will add features of a cat and umbrella. This game will be a ongoing game that will stop once the player fails to keep the cat under the umbrella thus gettin it wet. I will need to implement code that will track the players keyboard inputs to movement to move the umbrella left and right. This is essentially the key mechanic of the game.

Challenges

So problems that may occur while trying to figure out my final project may be images and how to implement them into the pygame module. For instance the umbrella and the cat. Another challenge is implementing code that uses keyboard inputs into the game. The last problem I may come across is optimizing my code so that it isn't confusing and hard to understand.

Outcomes

The ideal coutcome is to have a well working game that does what it is intented to do. Also maybe adding animation to the cat as it walks across the screen.
But if that isn't the outcome then I would want to go for maybe a gif like screen that has a cat in the middle of the screen with an umbrella on top of it as the rain is pouring down.

Weekly Milestones

Week 1 Implement Rain.py code

Week 2 Figure out how to add images that resemble a cat and umbrella into the game

Week 3 Add the code that will give the player control over the umbrella and add code that will control the cat

Week 4 Make sure everything in the code is working as intented and see if anything can be added
